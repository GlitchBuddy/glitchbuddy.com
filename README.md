# GlitchBuddy.com

This is the official HTML5 source for the GlitchBuddy.com website. This is my first time creating an actual functioning website all on my own, so don't expect it to be anything glamorous (at least for now...)

Special thanks to [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) and [Nomnomnami](https://nomnomnami.com), whose freely available code snippets helped me a lot during the learning process.
