This is the source "code" for the GlitchBuddy.com home page.
It's essentially a mish-mash of other peoples' code, which I am learning the meaning of as I go.
I'd like to thank W3Schools for creating free and understandable lessons on the basics of HTML and CSS.
I'd also like to thank Nomnomnami (https://nomnomnami.com), whose Neocities website served as a good template in the creation of this one.

Whenever there are large snippets of code I have copied directly from another website, I will credit the originating site with an HTML comment, just like this one.

Feel free to copy any of the code you see here for your own personal project(s).

    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official site of GlitchBuddy. I am a small independent artist who focuses on character design and worldbuilding.<br></p>
    <p>This web site is new and is very much under construction. Most of what I do has been uploaded to my Newgrounds account, accessible using the link below:</p>
    <a href="https://glitchbuddy.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a>
    <p><br>I hope to eventually mirror my portfolio here in the future, with more organised pages for each of my projects. As for what else I'll be doing, we shall see. We shall see...</p>
