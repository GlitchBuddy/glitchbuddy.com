This is the source "code" for the GlitchBuddy.com home page.
It's essentially a mish-mash of other peoples' code, which I am learning the meaning of as I go.
I'd like to thank W3Schools for creating free and understandable lessons on the basics of HTML and CSS.
I'd also like to thank Nomnomnami (https://nomnomnami.com), whose Neocities website served as a good template in the creation of this one.

Whenever there are large snippets of code I have copied directly from another website, I will credit the originating site with an HTML comment, just like this one.

Feel free to copy any of the code you see anywhere on the site for your own personal project(s). No credit is required.

    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the official site of GlitchBuddy! I am a small independent artist who focuses on character design and worldbuilding, among other things. I have been making art on and off since 2022, and in that time I've built up quite the cast of lovable characters (if I do say so myself).<br></p>
    <p>You can explore the site using the navigation bar at the top, just under the logo. Right now a lot of planned features and pages are under construction, so there may not be much up there, but rest assured things are actively being worked on and I'm excited to show them to you once they're ready. For now, you can read about me in the "About" section, and get a glimpse into the worlds I've developed in the "Projects" page.<br></p>
