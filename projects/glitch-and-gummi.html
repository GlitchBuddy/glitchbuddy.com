    <p>Glitch &amp; Gummi is a project about two best friends who live, work and hang out together, rarely ever leaving each others' side.<br></p>
    <p>Glitch is a Digicube, a cheap toy robot, who inexplicably one day gained sentience. Gummi is a Squnkian, a tiny species of gumdrop-shaped creatures. They both found themselves on the planet Nu, on the city-island of Teknotown, where they eventually met at a local arcade. They quickly became best friends, and moved in with each other not long after. Ever since then, they've been navigating the many ups and downs of their lives, from the mundane formalities of work to the wacky escapades one might get into if they turn a wrong corner...<br><br></p>
    <p>I'm currently in the process of putting my art and character lore directly onto the site, but for now you can find this project on <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/playlist/469445/glitch-gummi">Newgrounds!</a></p>
