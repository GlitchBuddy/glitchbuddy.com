    <p>Cyril the Cylinder is a project about Cyril, a cylindrical creature who has made a name for himself as a heroic adventurer!<br></p>
    <p>Waking up from deep within a cave with no recollection of his origins, Cyril stumbled into the tiny village of Plingplong shortly after finding his way out. He met Reno, the leader of the village, who introduced him to life in the outside world. But before Cyril could say hi to the other residents, the village's grand treasure, a heart-shaped gem, was stolen from right under their noses! Without a second thought, Cyril immediately offered to help bring it back, and thus he would set off on what would be the first of many adventures!<br><br></p>
    <p>I'm currently in the process of putting my art and character lore directly onto the site, but for now you can find this project on <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/426524/cyril-the-cylinder">Newgrounds!</a></p>
