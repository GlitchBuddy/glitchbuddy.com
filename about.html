    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Greetings! My name is GlitchBuddy, but you can just call me Glitch.<br></p>
    <p>I am a small independent artist from the United Kingdom with a strong focus on character design and worldbuilding. It's exactly what it says on the tin: I design characters, their stories, the worlds they live in, the stories of those worlds, etc...<br></p>
    <p>However, that's not all that I do! I created my own font, <a href="https://github.com/GlitchBuddy/GlitchPixel">GlitchPixel</a>... the font you're looking at right now! I'm also in the process of making a game, although who knows how long that will take. There are so many other things I want to try my hand at, it would be a pain to list them all here!<br></p>
    <p>I may not be the best at drawing, but I can promise you that everything I do, I do with genuine passion. I love the lil guys I design, and I aim to make that love visible in all of my works. I'm also a big believer in openness; most of my work is licenced under Creative Commons, and some of it is even in the public domain!<br></p>
    <p>As of now, all of my work is hosted exclusively on my Newgrounds page, although I'm working towards mirroring my portfolio on this website as well.<br><br></p>
    <h2>My links</h2>
    <p>My Newgrounds page is where I have been uploading all of my art since 2022. It's also where you can find other art I've enjoyed, as well as blog posts and the occasional forum-browsing.</p>
    <a href="https://glitchbuddy.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a>
    <p><br>My GitHub is where you can find all the code for my programming/computer projects (right now just this website and my fonts).</p>
